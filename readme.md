# Ground Water Level Prediction

This repository contains the code and data for predicting ground water levels using various machine learning models. We have explored and implemented the following models:

1. Regression: We have used linear regression models to predict ground water levels based on historical data and relevant features.

2. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): ARIMA models are used to capture the temporal dependencies in the data and make predictions based on the past values.

3. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): LSTM models are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can effectively capture long-term dependencies in time series data. We have implemented LSTM models to predict ground water levels.

4. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): GRU models are another type of recurrent neural network that can capture temporal dependencies. We have experimented with GRU models to compare their performance with other models.
